    "For my final project I decided to explore the potential options for relocation to Kitchener or Waterloo, Ontario. In the current economic situation in Western Canada some families can consider potential relocation to other provinces. This project mainly inspired by my personal thoughts and I used it as an opportunity to practice what I learned during this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several open resources where people can find information about potential target location, but most of the time it is unstructured and, in many cases, biased information. Some websites based only tourist attractions and reviews; others pulled information from real estate agencies, food chains, etc. When someone decided to conduct a research about particular town or area, in the best case it would take more than a dozen of different search requests. The results might be not as informative as it was anticipated. Eventually it is going to be a question – what is next? Where to look for more information? \n",

The communities/neighborhoods are relatively small with not too many venues in each separate community. The best option to group communities is by using Ward numbers. In average every Ward includes three communities. Total 17 wards (ten in Kitchener and seven in Waterloo).\n",

The website provides various statistical data, maps, dataset, etc., in form of CSV or shape files. The following shape files were created on Kitchener GeoHub: \n",
    "* Addresses – physical address of the buildings in Waterloo area\n",
    "* Ward Boundaries – file containing polygons for every Ward in both cities\n",
    "* Educational Facilities – locations of every educational institution in both cities.\n",

    "These shape files were loaded to QGIS © software to create customized JSON files. For the Ward center file the coordinates of the building in geographical center of the ward area was used. After selecting 17 addresses the JSON file with ward cetner coordinates was generated. For the educational facilities file no cleaning or manual selection were required – shape files were loaded and JSON files generated.\n",
